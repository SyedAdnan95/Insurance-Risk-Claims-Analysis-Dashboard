1. Project Title :

Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis Dashboard
A comprehensive, data-driven Power BI dashboard designed to analyze and visualize insurance policy trends, claim behavior, and customer risk patterns across multiple dimensions — enabling insurers to make smarter, evidence-based business decisions.

2. Purpose :

The Insurance Risk & Claims Analysis Dashboard provides an interactive overview of how different customer and vehicle attributes influence policy distribution and claim patterns. It helps insurance professionals quickly identify trends, measure claim frequency, and evaluate financial exposure across demographics, coverage zones, and education levels.
The purpose of this dashboard is to simplify complex insurance data and present actionable insights that enhance risk assessment, pricing, and customer segmentation.

3. Tech Stack :

This dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Core platform for dashboard creation, visualization, and interactivity.

⚙️ Power Query Editor – Used for data cleaning, shaping, and preparing datasets for modeling.

🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Created custom calculations for KPIs like claim frequency, average claim amount, and gender-based policy counts.

🧠 Data Modeling – Established relationships among data tables (policies, claims, demographics, and car details) for accurate cross-analysis.

📁 File Format – Developed in .pbix format and exported as .png for presentation or GitHub preview.

4. Data Source :

Source: Simulated dataset of insurance policy and claim information.
The dataset includes fields covering:

Policy Details: Policy number, policy type, total claim amount, and coverage zone.

Customer Demographics: Age group, gender, marital status, and education level.

Vehicle Data: Car make, model year, and usage type (private/commercial).

Claims Information: Claim frequency and average claim amount per policy.

This structure allows for cross-comparisons across policy types, demographics, and vehicle-related factors to uncover deeper patterns in risk and performance.

5. Features :
• Business Problem

Insurance providers often face difficulty analyzing large volumes of customer and claims data to determine which demographics or vehicle types pose higher risk. Traditional reporting lacks the visual clarity needed for strategic decision-making.

Key questions include:

Which age groups and car types generate the most policies?

What customer segments have the highest average claim amount?

How do coverage zones or education levels influence claim frequency?

Are there patterns in claim behavior that can improve underwriting or pricing strategies?

• Goal of the Dashboard

To deliver an intuitive and interactive visual solution that enables:

Quick assessment of policy and claim trends across demographics.

Identification of high-claim risk groups for targeted policy management.

Evaluation of total claim distribution by education, marital status, and car characteristics.

Enhanced understanding of the insurer’s customer base for better forecasting and business planning.
